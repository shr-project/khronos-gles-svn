Number

    OpenGL ES Extension #40

Dependencies

    Written based on the wording of the OpenGL ES 1.1 specification.

Overview

    This extension enables support for ATC compressed texture formats.  ATC is 
    AMD's proprietary compression algorithm for compressing textures for 
    handheld devices to save on power consumption, memory footprint and 
    bandwidth.

    Two compression formats are introduced:

    - A compression format for RGB textures.
    - A compression format for RGBA textures.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.

New Tokens

    Accepted by the <internalformat> parameter of CompressedTexImage2D and
    CompressedTexImage3DOES.

        ATC_RGB_AMD                        0x8C92
        ATC_RGBA_AMD                       0x8C93

Additions to Chapter 2 of the OpenGL 1.3 Specification (OpenGL Operation)

    None.

Additions to Chapter 3 of the OpenGL 1.3 Specification (Rasterization)

    Add to Table 3.17:  Specific Compressed Internal Formats

        Compressed Internal Format         Base Internal Format
        ==========================         ====================
        ATC_RGB_AMD                        RGB
        ATC_RGBA_AMD                       RGBA


    Add to Section 3.8.3, Alternate Image Specification

    The details of these formats is not disclosed, so refer to AMD's 
    Compressonator tool in order to encode your textures offline:
    http://ati.amd.com/developer/compressonator.html
    
    OpenGL ES requires that all mip-levels have to be specified when
    CompressedTexImage2D is called to load a palettized texture.  In this case 
    the "level" value is either 0 or a negative number to indicate the number of
    mip-levels.  This rule is not followed when loading an ATC texture.  The 
    "level" number in this case represents the actual mip-level number,
    so a negative number will raise an error.

    ATC_RGB_AMD Format
    ==================

    This format compresses blocks of source texels down to 4 bits per texel.
    Assuming 8-bit component source texels, this represents a 6:1 compression
    ratio.

    ATC_RGBA_AMD Format
    ===================

    This format compresses blocks of source texels down to 8 bits per texel.
    Assuming 8-bit component source texels, this represents a 4:1 compression
    ratio.

Errors

    None.

New State

    The queries for NUM_COMPRESSED_TEXTURE_FORMATS and 
    COMPRESSED_TEXTURE_FORMATS include ATC_RGB_AMD and ATC_RGBA_AMD.
