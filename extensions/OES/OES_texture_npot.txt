Number

    OpenGL ES Extension #37    

Dependencies

    OpenGL ES 2.0 is required.

    OES_texture_3D is also referenced.

Overview

    This extension adds support for the REPEAT and MIRRORED_REPEAT
    texture wrap modes and the minification filters supported for 
    non-power of two 2D textures, cubemaps and for 3D textures, if
    the OES_texture_3D extension is supported.

    Section 3.8.6 of the OpenGL ES 2.0 specification describes
    the rules for a 2D, 3D textures or cubemap to be complete.  There
    were specific rules added for non-power of two textures i.e.
    if the texture wrap mode is not CLAMP_TO_EDGE or minification
    filter is not NEAREST or LINEAR and the texture is a non-power
    of two texture, then the texture would be marked as incomplete.

    This rule that determines if a non-power of two 2D, 3D texture or 
    cubemap is texture complete is no longer applied by an implementation 
    that supports this extension.
