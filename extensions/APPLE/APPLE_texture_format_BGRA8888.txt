    OpenGL ES Extension #79

Dependencies

    Written based on the wording of the OpenGL ES 1.1 specification.

Overview

    This extension introduces BGRA_EXT as an acceptable external format.  
    This avoids byte swizzling when loading RGBA internal format
    textures, which may be stored in BGRA order internally.

Issues

    None.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.

New Tokens

    Accepted by the <format> parameters of TexImage2D and TexSubImage2D:

        GL_BGRA_EXT                                 0x80E1

Additions to Chapter 2 of the OpenGL ES 1.1 Specification (OpenGL ES Operation)

    None

Additions to Chapter 3 of the OpenGL ES 1.1 Specification (Rasterization)

    Section 3.6.2, add the following row to Table 3.3:
    
        Format Name    Element Meaning and Order    Target Buffer
        -----------    -------------------------    -------------
        BGRA_EXT       B, G, R, A                   Color

    Section 3.6.2, add the following row to Table 3.4:
    
        Format      Type             Bytes per Pixel
        --------    -------------    ---------------
        BGRA_EXT    UNSIGNED_BYTE    4

    Section 3.7.1, change the 4th paragraph to loosen the requirement that
    <internalformat> must match <format> for the case of BGRA_EXT format, which
    must have an RGBA internal format.  In this case we do not generate the
    error INVALID_OPERATION.

Additions to Chapter 4 of the OpenGL ES 1.1 Specification (Per-Fragment Operations and the Framebuffer)

    None

Additions to Chapter 5 of the OpenGL ES 1.1 Specification (Special Functions)

    None

Additions to Chapter 6 of the OpenGL ES 1.1 Specification (State and State Requests)

    None

Errors

    INVALID_ENUM is generated by TexImage2D if <internalformat> is BGRA_EXT.

    INVALID_OPERATION is generated by TexImage2D if <format> is BGRA_EXT and
    <internalformat> is not RGBA.

New State

    None

New Implementation Dependent State

    None
