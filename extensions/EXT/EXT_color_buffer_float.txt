Additions to Chapter 3 of the OpenGL ES 3.0 Specification
(Rasterization)

    (changed lines marked with *; added lines marked with +)

    3.8.3 Texture Image Specification, unnumbered subsection "Required
    Texture Formats", pp. 127 & 128

    Change the first two bullet items to the following:

    - Texture and renderbuffer color formats (see section 4.4.2).
      - RGBA32F, RGBA32I, RGBA32UI, RGBA16F, RGBA16I, RGBA16UI,
        RGBA8, RGBA8I, RGBA8UI, SRGB8_ALPHA8, RGB10_A2, RGB10_-
        A2UI, RGBA4, and RGB5_A1.
      - RGB8 and RGB565.
      - R11F G11F B10F.
      - RG32F, RG32I, RG32UI, RG16F, RG16I, RG16UI, RG8, RG8I, and
        RG8UI.
      - R32F, R32I, R32UI, R16F, R16I, R16UI, R8, R8I, and R8UI.

    - Texture-only color formats:
      - RGBA8_SNORM.
      - RGB32F, RGB32I, and RGB32UI.
      - RGB16F, RGB16I, and RGB16UI.
      - RGB8_SNORM, RGB8I, RGB8UI, and SRGB8.
      - RGB9_E5.
      - RG8_SNORM.
      - R8_SNORM.

    Table 3.13, pp. 129, 130 & 131

    Convert the dash under 'Color-renderable' to a 'check' for the
    following internal formats: R16F, RG16F, RGBA16F, R32F, RG32F,
    RGBA32F and R11F_G11F_B10F.

    3.8.5 Alternate Texture Image Specification Commands, p. 138

    In the first paragraph, change the sentence beginning "The error
    INVALID_OPERATION is generated ..." to

 *  The error INVALID_OPERATION is generated if signed integer RGBA
    data is required and the format of the current color buffer is not
    signed integer; if unsigned integer RGBA data is required and the
    format of the current color buffer is not unsigned integer; or if
 *  floating- or fixed-point RGBA data is required and the format of
 *  the current color buffer is signed or unsigned integer.
    
    Insert the following bullet into the rules for determining the
    effective internal format before the "Otherwise" rule on p. 140

    o If the source buffer contains any floating point components
      the effective internalformat is taken from the first (highest)
      row in table 3.17 for which the values of FRAMEBUFFER_RED_SIZE, 
      FRAMEBUFFER_GREEN_SIZE, FRAMEBUFFER_BLUE_SIZE, and
      FRAMEBUFFER_ALPHA_SIZE are consistent. If the sizes are not
      consistent for any rows in the table then an INVALID_OPERATION
      error is generated.

    Insert new table 3.17 on p141 and renumber other tables and
    references accordingly.

    Destination |              |              |              |              | Effective
    Internal    | Source       | Source       | Source       | Source       | Internal
    Format      | Red Size     | Green Size   | Blue Size    | Alpha Size   | Format
    ------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------
    any sized   | 1 <= R <= 16 | G = 0        | B = 0        | A = 0        | R16F
    any sized   | 1 <= R <= 16 | 1 <= G <= 16 | B = 0        | A = 0        | RG16F
    any sized   | 16 < R       | G = 0        | B = 0        | A = 0        | R32F
    any sized   | 16 < R       | 16 < G       | B = 0        | A = 0        | RG32F
    any sized   | 1 <= R <= 16 | 1 <= G <= 16 | 1 <= B <= 16 | A = 0        | RGB16F
    any sized   | 1 <= R <= 16 | 1 <= G <= 16 | 1 <= B <= 16 | 1 <= A <= 16 | RGBA16F
    any sized   | 16 < R       | 16 < G       | 16 < B       | A = 0        | RGB32F
    any sized   | 16 < R       | 16 < G       | 16 < B       | 16 < A       | RGBA32F

    Table 3.17: Effective internal format for float-point framebuffers

    
Additions to Chapter 4 of the OpenGL ES 3.0 Specification (Per-Fragment
Operations and the Framebuffer)

    Chapter 4 Introduction, p. 170

    Paragraph 5, sentence 3, p 171, insert "floating point" as shown:
        "R, G, B, and A components may be represented as unsigned
 *      normalized fixed-point, floating point or signed or unsigned
        integer values; ..."    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    4.1.7 Blending, p. 177

    Modify paragraphs 3 & 4:
    
 *      "If the color buffer is fixed-point, the components of the
    source and destination values and blend factors are clamped
 *  to [0; 1] prior to evaluating the blend equation. If the color
 +  buffer is floating-point, no clamping occurs. The resulting four
 +  values are sent to the next operation.
    
        Blending applies only if the color buffer has a fixed-point or
 *  or floating-point format. If the color buffer has an integer
 *  format, proceed to the next operation.  Furthermore, an
 +  INVALID_OPERATION error is generated by DrawArrays and the other
 +  drawing commands defined in section 2.8.3 if blending is enabled
 +  (see below) and any draw buffer has a 32-bit floating-point
 +  format."

    4.2.3 Clearing the Buffers, p. 186

    Modify second paragraph, inserting "floating point":

    "   void ClearColor(float r, float g, float b, float a);

 *  sets the clear value for fixed- and floating-point color buffers.
    ..."                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    4.3.2 Reading Pixels, p. 190

    In paragraph 4, beginning "Only two combinations of format
    and type are accepted ...", after the sentence ending "... type
    UNSIGNED_BYTE is accepted." insert the following sentence:
        "For floating-point rendering surfaces, the combination
        format RGBA and type FLOAT is accepted."

    4.3.2 unnumbered subsection "Obtaining Pixels from the Framebuffer",
    p. 192

    Modify penultimate paragraph, p192, "If format is an integer ..."

    "If format is an integer format and the color buffer is not an
    integer format; if the color buffer is an integer format and
 *  format is not an integer format; if format is an integer format
 *  and type is FLOAT, HALF_FLOAT, or UNSIGNED_INT_10F_11F_11F_REV;
 +  or if the color buffer is a floating-point format and type is
 +  not FLOAT, HALF FLOAT, or UNSIGNED_INT_10F_11F_11F_REV, the error
    INVALID_OPERATION occurs."

    4.3.2 unnumbered subsection "Conversion of RGBA values", p.193

    Sole paragraph, sentence 3, insert "or floating point" as shown:
 *      "For an integer or floating point color buffer, the elements
        are unmodified."^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    4.3.3 Copying Pixels, p195

    Modify first error condition, at bottom of p196, "The read buffer
    contains ..." to encompass floating-point buffers.

 *  "- The read buffer contains fixed-point or floating-point values
 *     and any draw buffer contains neither fixed-point nor
 *     floating-point values."

    4.4.2 Attaching Images to Framebuffer Objects, p. 201, unnumbered
    subsection "Required Renderbuffer Formats", pp. 203, 204

    In the last paragraph beginning "Implementations must support
    creation ...", modify the final phrase to

 *   "with the exception of signed and unsigned integer, RGBA16F,
 +   R32F, RG32F and RGBA32F formats.

Additions to Chapter 5 of the OpenGL ES 2.0 Specification (Special Functions)

    None

Additions to Chapter 6 of the OpenGL ES 2.0 Specification (State and State
Requests)

    6.1.15 Internal Format Queries, p. 241

    In paragraph 8 after "Since multisampling is not supported
    for signed and unsigned integer internal formats, the value of
    NUM_SAMPLE_COUNTS will be zero for such formats.", insert new
    one-sentence paragraph:

        "If <internalformat> is RGBA16F, R32F, RG32F, or RGBA32F, the
        value of NUM_SAMPLE_COUNTS may be zero, or else the maximum
        value in SAMPLES may be less than the value of MAX_SAMPLES."
