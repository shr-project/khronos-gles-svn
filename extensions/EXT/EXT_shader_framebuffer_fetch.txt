    OpenGL ES Extension #122

Dependencies

    OpenGL ES 2.0 is required.
    
    This specification is written against the OpenGL ES 2.0.24 specification.
    This extension is written against the OpenGL ES Shading Language 1.0.17
    specification.

Overview

    Conventional OpenGL blending provides a configurable series of operations
    that can be used to combine the output values from a fragment shader with
    the values already in the framebuffer. While these operations are
    suitable for basic image compositing, other compositing operations or
    operations that treat fragment output as something other than a color
    (normals, for instance) may not be expressible without multiple passes or
    render-to-texture operations.

    This extension provides a mechanism whereby a fragment shader may read
    existing framebuffer data as input. This can be used to implement
    compositing operations that would have been inconvenient or impossible with
    fixed-function blending. It can also be used to apply a function to the
    framebuffer color, by writing a shader which uses the existing framebuffer
    color as its only input.

Issues

    1. How is framebuffer data treated during multisample rendering?
    
    RESOLVED: Reading the value of gl_LastFragData produces a different
    result for each sample. This implies that all or part of the shader be run
    once for each sample. Input values to the shader from existing variables
    in GLSL ES remain identical across samples.
    
    2. How does the use of gl_LastFragData interact with fragment discard?
    
    RESOLVED: Hardware may not necessarily support discarding on sample
    granularity. Therefore, three options were considered for this
    functionality:
    
        A) Allow discard based on variables calculated using the framebuffer
           color when multisample rasterization is disabled, but disallow
           discard in this manner when multisample rasterization is enabled.
        
        B) Restrict usage of the framebuffer color until it is known whether
           or not the pixel will be discarded.
            
        C) Allow undefined results for fragment shaders that discard on a
           per-sample basis on hardware that doesn't support it.
    
    This extension has chosen option C. Restricting orthogonality of fragment
    shaders between single-sample and multisample rendering is undesirable, as
    is restricting usage of the framebuffer color, which can generally only be
    done with detailed flow-control analysis.
    
    3. What is the precision of gl_LastFragData in practice?
    
    RESOLVED: Three options were considered for this functionality:
    
        A) gl_LastFragData is always mediump.
        
        B) gl_LastFragData takes the precision most closely matching the
           actual storage format of the framebuffer.
        
        C) Allow redeclaration of gl_LastFragData in order to change its
           precision.
    
    This extension has chosen option C. A fixed precision per option A
    increases the likelihood of redundant conversion operations in the shader,
    and option B does not provide for clear behavior with regard to the
    precision of intermediate results from calculations using the
    framebuffer color.

    4. How does this extension iteract with conventional blending?
    
    RESOLVED: There is no interaction.  The two remain orthogonal.  The rest
    of the pipeline continues as usual after the fragment shader stage.
    
New Procedures and Functions

    None
    
New Tokens

    Accepted by the <pname> parameter of GetBooleanv, GetIntegerv, GetFloatv,
    and GetDoublev:
    
        FRAGMENT_SHADER_DISCARDS_SAMPLES_EXT            0x8A52

New Builtin Variables

    mediump vec4 gl_LastFragData[gl_MaxDrawBuffers]
    
Changes to the OpenGL ES 2.0.24 Specification, Chapter 3

    Remove the last sentence of Paragraph 2 of Section 3.8.1, page 84 ("These
    built-in varying variables include [...]" and add:
    
    These built-in varying variables include the fragment's position, eye z
    coordinate, and front-facing flag, as well as the last data or color value
    written to the framebuffer. When the value of SAMPLE_BUFFERS is 1 and the 
    current framebuffer color is accessed in the fragment shader, the fragment
    shader will be invoked separately for each covered sample and a separate 
    value for the previous framebuffer color will be provided for each sample."
    
    Add a new subsection to section 3.8.2, page 87 ("Shader Execution"):
    
    "Discard
    
    Fragment shaders may conditionally abandon operations using the discard
    keyword. However, the ability of hardware to support abandoning operations
    on a single sample when the shader is invoked once for each covered sample
    is implementation-dependent. This capability can be determined by calling
    GetBooleanv with the symbolic constant 
    FRAGMENT_SHADER_DISCARDS_SAMPLES_EXT. If FALSE is returned, results from
    shaders which discard based on per-sample logic are undefined."

Changes to the OpenGL ES 2.0.24 Specification, Chapter 4

    Replace first element of Figure 4.1, page 90 ("Fragment + Associated Data"):
    
    "Fragment (or sample) + Associated Data"

New Implementation Dependent State

    Add to table 6.19 (Implementation Dependent Values (cont.)):

    Get Value                             Type  Get Command  Minimum Value  Description        Section
    ---------                             ----  -----------  -------------  --------------     -------
    FRAGMENT_SHADER_DISCARDS_SAMPLES_EXT  B     GetBooleanv  -              Samples may be     3.8.2
                                                                            discarded 
                                                                            individually 

Changes to the OpenGL ES Shading Language 1.0.17 Specification, Chapter 3

    Remove Paragraph 2 of section 3.8, page 17, Identifiers ("Identifiers
    starting with "gl_" are reserved [...]") and add:

    "Identifiers starting with "gl_" are reserved for use by OpenGL ES, and
    may not be declared in a shader as either a variable or a function.
    However, as noted in the specification, certain predeclared "gl_" names
    are allowed to be redeclared in a shader for the specific purpose of
    changing their precision qualifier."
    
Changes to the OpenGL ES Shading Language 1.0.17 Specification, Chapter 7

    Add after the last sentence of Paragraph 2 of Section 7.2, page 60,
    Fragment Shader Special Variables ("These variables may be written to
    more [...]"):
    
    "... To access the existing framebuffer values (e.g., to implement a
    complex blend operation inside the shader), fragment shaders should use
    the read-only input array gl_LastFragData.  gl_LastFragData returns the
    value written by the most recent fragment at the same position.
    
    Access to gl_LastFragData is optional, and must be enabled by 
    
    #extension GL_EXT_shader_framebuffer_fetch : <behavior>
    
    Where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.3.
    
    By default, gl_LastFragData is declared with the mediump precision
    qualifier. This can be changed by redeclaring the corresponding variables
    with the desired precision qualifier.
    
    Redeclarations are done as follows
    
    // Redeclaration that changes nothing is allowed
    mediump vec4 gl_LastFragData[gl_MaxDrawBuffers]; 
    
    // All the following are allowed redeclaration that change behavior
    lowp vec4 gl_LastFragData[gl_MaxDrawBuffers];
    highp vec4 gl_LastFragData[gl_MaxDrawBuffers];
    
    Redeclarations must not otherwise alter the declared type or array size of
    gl_LastFragData."
    
Interactions with OES_standard_derivatives

    Results from shaders which use the built-in derivative functions dFdx,
    dFdy, and fwidth on variables calculated using the current framebuffer 
    color are undefined.
